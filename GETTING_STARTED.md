# Getting Started with GigaChad GRC

This guide will help you get GigaChad GRC running on your computer in under 10 minutes.

---

## Prerequisites

You only need **one thing** installed: **Docker Desktop**

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is a free application that runs the GigaChad GRC platform.

#### macOS
1. Go to [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Click **"Download for Mac"**
   - Choose **Apple Silicon** if you have an M1/M2/M3 Mac
   - Choose **Intel** if you have an older Mac
3. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
4. Drag Docker to your Applications folder
5. Open Docker from Applications
6. Wait for Docker to start (you'll see a whale icon in your menu bar)

#### Windows
1. Go to [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Click **"Download for Windows"**
3. Run the installer
4. **Important:** When prompted, ensure "Use WSL 2" is checked
5. Restart your computer if prompted
6. Open Docker Desktop from the Start menu
7. Wait for Docker to start (you'll see a whale icon in your system tray)

> **Windows Note:** You may need to enable virtualization in your BIOS. If Docker won't start, search "enable virtualization [your computer brand]" for instructions.

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add your user to docker group (logout/login required after)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
```

### Step 2: Verify Docker is Running

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like: `Docker version 24.0.0, build abcdef`

If you see an error, make sure Docker Desktop is running (look for the whale icon).

## Starting GigaChad GRC

### Option A: Download and Run (Easiest)

#### macOS / Linux

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
# Download the project
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/gigachad-grc.git

# Go into the folder
cd gigachad-grc

# Start the application
./start.sh
```

#### Windows

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

```cmd
# Download the project
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/gigachad-grc.git

# Go into the folder
cd gigachad-grc

# Start the application
start.bat
```

### What Happens Next

1. **First Run (3-5 minutes):** Docker downloads and builds all the components
2. **You'll see:** Progress messages as each service starts
3. **When ready:** Your browser opens to http://localhost:3000

> **Tip:** Subsequent starts only take 30-60 seconds!

---

## Accessing the Application

Once started, open your browser to:

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **GigaChad GRC** | http://localhost:3000 | Click "Dev Login" button |
| API Documentation | http://localhost:3001/api/docs | None needed |
| Keycloak (Auth) | http://localhost:8080 | admin / admin |
| Grafana (Monitoring) | http://localhost:3003 | admin / admin |

### How to Log In

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click the green **"Dev Login"** button
3. You're in! No username or password needed for demo mode.

---

## Common Commands

### macOS / Linux

```bash
./start.sh          # Start the application
./start.sh stop     # Stop the application
./start.sh status   # Check if services are running
./start.sh logs     # View live logs (Ctrl+C to exit)
```

### Windows

```cmd
start.bat           # Start the application
start.bat stop      # Stop the application
start.bat status    # Check if services are running
start.bat logs      # View live logs (Ctrl+C to exit)
```

---

## Loading Demo Data

When you first log in, you'll see a welcome screen with two options:

1. **"Try with Demo Data"** - Loads sample controls, frameworks, policies, and vendors
2. **"Start from Scratch"** - Empty workspace to build your own

We recommend starting with demo data to explore the features!

## Troubleshooting

### Docker isn't running

**Symptom:** Error message about Docker not being found or not running

**Solution:**
1. Look for the Docker whale icon in your menu bar (Mac) or system tray (Windows)
2. If not there, open Docker Desktop from your Applications/Start Menu
3. Wait 30-60 seconds for Docker to fully start
4. Try the command again

### Port already in use

**Symptom:** Error about port 3000, 3001, or another port being in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop any running containers
./start.sh stop

# If that doesn't work, force stop everything
docker compose down -v

# Start fresh
./start.sh
```

### Services won't start (Windows)

**Symptom:** Containers exit immediately or show unhealthy

**Solution:**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Settings → Resources
3. Ensure you have at least:
   - **CPUs:** 4
   - **Memory:** 8 GB
   - **Disk:** 20 GB
4. Click "Apply & Restart"

### Slow performance

**Symptom:** Application is sluggish or pages load slowly

**Solution (Mac):**
1. Open Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources
2. Increase Memory to 8GB or more
3. Enable "Use Virtualization Framework" (Apple Silicon)

**Solution (Windows):**
1. Open Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → WSL Integration
2. Enable integration with your WSL distro
3. Run commands from within WSL for better performance

### Linux Server: "operation not permitted" errors

**Symptom:** Containers show `exec /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: operation not permitted`

This happens on Linux servers with AppArmor or SELinux enabled.

**Solution 1: Disable AppArmor for Docker (Ubuntu/Debian)**
```bash
# Stop AppArmor
sudo systemctl stop apparmor
sudo systemctl disable apparmor

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Try again
./start.sh
```

**Solution 2: Disable SELinux for Docker (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora)**
```bash
# Temporarily disable SELinux
sudo setenforce 0

# Or permanently (edit /etc/selinux/config and set SELINUX=permissive)
sudo sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Try again
./start.sh
```

**Solution 3: Run with elevated privileges (not recommended for production)**
```bash
# Add :z flag to volumes for SELinux
# Or run containers with --privileged flag
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

### How to completely reset

If something is really broken, start fresh:

```bash
# Stop everything and remove all data
docker compose down -v

# Remove built images
docker rmi $(docker images 'gigachad-grc-*' -q) 2>/dev/null

# Start fresh
./start.sh
```
